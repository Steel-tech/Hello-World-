    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I’m Victor Garcia, owner of Flawless Steel Welding—an AISC-certified steel fabrication and erection company based in Denver, Colorado. For the past 14+ years, I’ve led teams in delivering complex commercial projects with precision, safety, and craftsmanship. I started out as an ironworker, learning the trade hands-on in the field, and worked my way up to building a company that now manages multi-million-dollar structural steel packages across Colorado.

While my roots are in steel, I’m also future-focused. I’m integrating AI, automation, and digital workflows into construction—building custom estimating systems, automating processes with n8n and GPT-based agents, and exploring APIs, Claude Code, and software development. My mission is clear: scale operations, eliminate inefficiencies, and grow from $7–9M to $14–16M in revenue while reducing reliance on me as the bottleneck.

Leadership defines how I operate. I push my teams hard because I believe in high standards and building things that last—whether it’s a steel structure, a business system, or a culture of accountability. I’m developing leadership training for foremen, mentoring the next generation of builders, and creating a management operating system that connects the field, shop, and office.

Beyond work, I’ve made a major health transformation—going from 376 lbs to 240 lbs—and I’m committed to living strong for my family. I’ve been married nearly 14 years, have a 13-year-old daughter, and stay grounded in faith as a long-time member of Christ Covenant Church. I enjoy movies, four-wheeling, golfing, and I’m working on becoming a better fisherman when I can sneak away from the shop. I also love learning new skills, like coding, to keep pushing myself forward.

At the end of the day, I’m about building—in steel, in code, and in people.</p>
