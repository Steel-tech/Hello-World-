<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<h2>I wish I would have done this back in Feb 2025 when I started looking into Coding.</h2>
<body> I began with Lovable Vide Coding, which led me to Claude Code. Now, I’m diving into the terminal—so if you’re considering it, know that this truly marks the beginning of my real coding journey.

I will be using this page to document my journey and share what I learn.
